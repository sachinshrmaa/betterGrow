# betterGrow

An open-source project for helping farmers grow better crops using  Data Science.



## Introduction

betterGrowth aims to makes use of technologies like the Internet of Things, cloud computing, Machine Learning, and Big Data to enable farmers to have more insights on the consequences of their actions and take a much better and informed decision on farming practices.

The power of smart farming lies in the fact that it goes beyond solving the shortcomings and pitfalls of agriculture. The application of Big Data is leaving significant impact on the entire realm of supply-chain, giving predictive insights on farming practices and operations, help redesign business models, deliver realtime decisions on operations and more.

### Components of Smart Farming

Smart farming is a network of interdisciplinary and complementing technologies and facilities. The components of smart farming are best if they comprise of the following:

#### Management Information Systems

This is generally the database where all chunks of data from multiple sensors and resources are gathered, stored, analyzed, and retrieved for actions. An optimized management information system should offer information on:

**Crops:**

- Crop stress
- Statuses on crop tissue nutrients
- Crop population
- Weed patches
- Fungal or insect infestation
- Crop yield
 
**Soil**

- Physical condition
- Soil texture
- Structure
- Moisture
- Nutrients and more
 
**Climate**

- Humidity
- Rainfall
- Wind speed
- Temperature
